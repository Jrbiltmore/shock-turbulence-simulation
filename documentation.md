# Fluid Solver Documentation

## Introduction

The Fluid Solver is a Python-based simulation tool that solves the 2D Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible flow. It uses a finite-difference method for spatial discretization and an explicit time-stepping scheme for time integration. The solver also includes turbulence modeling and shock-capturing techniques to handle turbulent flow and shock waves, respectively.

## Getting Started

To use the Fluid Solver, you need to have Python installed on your system. The code is designed to work with Python 3.7 or later. To install the required dependencies, you can use `pip` as follows:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## Code Structure

The Fluid Solver codebase is organized into several modules to maintain clarity and modularity. Here is a brief overview of the main modules:

1. `fluid_solver.py`: Contains the `FluidSolver` class, which is the main class that handles the fluid simulation.

2. `turbulence_model.py`: Contains the `TurbulenceModel` class, which implements the turbulence modeling for the fluid solver.

3. `shock_model.py`: Contains the `ShockModel` class, which implements the shock-capturing techniques for the fluid solver.

4. `plasma_physics.py`: Contains additional classes and functions related to plasma physics, which can be extended for specific applications.

5. `visualization.py`: Provides functions for visualizing the simulation results using Matplotlib.

6. `analysis.py`: Contains functions to analyze turbulence statistics from the simulation results.

7. `input_parameters.py`: Holds the input parameters for the simulation, such as grid size, time step, number of time steps, turbulence model, and shock model.

8. `utils.py`: Contains utility functions used throughout the codebase.

9. `parallelization.py`: Provides functions for parallelizing computations using multiple CPU cores.

## Usage

To run the Fluid Solver, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary classes and functions from the relevant modules.

2. Set the input parameters for the simulation, such as grid size, time step, and number of time steps.

3. Create instances of the `TurbulenceModel` and `ShockModel` classes to model turbulence and shock interactions, respectively.

4. Create an instance of the `FluidSolver` class, passing the input parameters and turbulence and shock models.

5. Call the `run_simulation()` method of the `FluidSolver` instance to perform the simulation.

6. Use the visualization and analysis functions as needed to analyze and visualize the simulation results.

Here is an example of how to use the Fluid Solver:

```python
# Import necessary classes and functions
from fluid_solver import FluidSolver
from turbulence_model import TurbulenceModel
from shock_model import ShockModel
from visualization import visualize_results
from analysis import analyze_turbulence_statistics

# Set input parameters
grid_size = 100
time_step = 0.01
num_time_steps = 100

# Create turbulence model and shock model instances
turbulence_model = TurbulenceModel()
shock_model = ShockModel()

# Create the Fluid Solver instance
fluid_solver = FluidSolver(grid_size, time_step, num_time_steps, turbulence_model, shock_model)

# Run the simulation
fluid_solver.run_simulation()

# Get the simulation results
velocity, pressure, density = fluid_solver.get_results()

# Visualize the simulation results
visualize_results(velocity, pressure, density)

# Analyze turbulence statistics
analyze_turbulence_statistics(velocity)
```
