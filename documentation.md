Introduction
The Fluid Solver is an advanced Python-based simulation tool that solves the 2D Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible flow. It provides a robust and efficient framework for simulating fluid dynamics, including turbulence modeling and shock-capturing techniques. The solver employs a finite-difference method for spatial discretization and an explicit time-stepping scheme for time integration.

Installation
To use the Fluid Solver, Python 3.7 or later must be installed on your system. To install the required dependencies, execute the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

Code Structure
The Fluid Solver codebase is structured into modular components to maintain clarity and extensibility. Here is a summary of the main modules:

1. fluid_solver.py: This module contains the FluidSolver class, which is the core of the fluid simulation process.

2. turbulence_model.py: Here, you will find the TurbulenceModel class, responsible for implementing turbulence modeling techniques.

3. shock_model.py: The ShockModel class resides here, which handles shock-capturing techniques.

4. plasma_physics.py: This module provides additional classes and functions related to plasma physics, extendable for specialized applications.

5. visualization.py: It offers functions for visualizing the simulation results using Matplotlib, making post-processing efficient.

6. analysis.py: Contains functions for analyzing turbulence statistics from the simulation results.

7. input_parameters.py: This module holds the input parameters for the simulation, such as grid size, time step, turbulence model, and shock model.

8. utils.py: Contains utility functions utilized throughout the codebase.

9. parallelization.py: Provides functions for parallelizing computations, optimizing the simulation for multiple CPU cores.

Usage
To run the Fluid Solver, follow these steps:

1. Import the relevant classes and functions from the respective modules.

2. Set the input parameters for the simulation, such as grid size, time step, and number of time steps.

3. Create instances of the TurbulenceModel and ShockModel classes to model turbulence and shock interactions.

4. Create an instance of the FluidSolver class, passing the input parameters and turbulence and shock models.

5. Call the run_simulation() method of the FluidSolver instance to perform the simulation.

6. Use the visualization and analysis functions as needed to analyze and visualize the simulation results.

Example:

```python
# Import necessary classes and functions
from fluid_solver import FluidSolver
from turbulence_model import TurbulenceModel
from shock_model import ShockModel
from visualization import visualize_results
from analysis import analyze_turbulence_statistics

# Set input parameters
grid_size = 100
time_step = 0.01
num_time_steps = 100

# Create turbulence model and shock model instances
turbulence_model = TurbulenceModel()
shock_model = ShockModel()

# Create the Fluid Solver instance
fluid_solver = FluidSolver(grid_size, time_step, num_time_steps, turbulence_model, shock_model)

# Run the simulation
fluid_solver.run_simulation()

# Get the simulation results
velocity, pressure, density = fluid_solver.get_results()

# Visualize the simulation results
visualize_results(velocity, pressure, density)

# Analyze turbulence statistics
analyze_turbulence_statistics(velocity)
